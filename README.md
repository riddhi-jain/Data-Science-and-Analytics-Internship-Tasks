### :point_right: Task-1 : Prediction using Supervised ML (Level - Beginner)
_Click on the icon on right side to view my submission._

1. Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
2. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
3. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool
4. Data can be found at [http://bit.ly/w-data](http://bit.ly/w-data)

### :point_right: Task-3 : Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm(Level - Intermediate)
_Click on the icon on right side to view my submission._

1. For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
2. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.
3. Data can be found at [https://bit.ly/3kXTdox](https://bit.ly/3kXTdox)

### :point_right: Task-5 : To Explore Business Analytics (Level - Beginner & Intermediate)
_Click on the icons on right side to view my submission._

1. Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’
2. As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
3. What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?
4. You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel)
5. Dataset link :[https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl](https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl)
6. Create storyboards. Screen record along with your audio explaining the charts and interpretations.
